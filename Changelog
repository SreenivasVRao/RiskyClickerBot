# 1 August 2017
> Fixed bug in markup handling.
> Fixed bug that allowed bot to post to subs where bots are disallowed.
> Fixed bug that allowed bot to recursively comment on its own analysis.
> Added better handling of multiline comments.
> Improved bot functioning from a local system. Bot now uses a memcache on local system as well as on Heroku.
  Previously, locally running bot would use a list which would never save to disk.
> Moved bot version to 1.1.
